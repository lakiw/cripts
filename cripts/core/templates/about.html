CRIPTs (Collaborative Research Into Password Threats) is an open source password repository that leverages other open source software to create a unified tool for analysts, security experts, and penetration testers engaged in password research. It is based on the CRITs tool initially developed at MITRE and then open sourced to support the greater infosec community.
